/**
 * This is the SimpleMimeReader class, which is a basic way to
 * process a multi-part MIME message/transmission (per 
 * <a href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1521.txt'>RFC 1521</a>).
 *
 * There are plenty of other classes out there that will do the 
 * same thing, and probably much better, but most of the ones that 
 * I found are geared towards Servlets, and only take an HttpServletRequest
 * or ServletInputStream as a parameter in the constructor (I wanted
 * to use any InputStream). Or they aren't compatible with the 
 * old 1.1.8 JDK that I end up having to work with a lot.
 * <p>
 * This implementation does very little storing of data, which
 * should make it more efficient, but it also means you can't go 
 * backwards to find a previous part of the message, and you only
 * have one chance to get the data in a message part (after it's
 * been read, any repeated attempts to read the same data will
 * simply return without doing anything). It's almost like a SAX
 * processor for MIME data in that way. I am, however, storing the 
 * header data for each message part as I get to that part, so you
 * can access the header and read its elements either before or
 * after you've accessed the part data (until you go to the next
 * part, anyway). The headers are usually small, and I didn't
 * think that this would hurt the performance too much.
 * <p>
 * If you really want to be able to go backwards and forwards
 * through a MIME message, it should be easy enough to run through
 * a message once using this reader and capture all of the message
 * parts in a Vector or something.
 * <p>
 * This implementation doesn't deal with nested multi-part messages,
 * so if one multi-part message is embedded within another, the
 * whole embedded message will be returned as a single chunk of
 * data within one of the message parts. You could always parse that
 * recursively yourself, using additional SimpleMimeReader instances.
 * Any Message/Partial parts will have to be assembled by you as well.
 * <p>
 * This implementation also doesn't do a lot of error checking to
 * see if this is a valid multi-part message or not. Essentially
 * it reads the first "header" on the InputStream (the first block
 * of data that ends with a blank line) and tries to find a MIME
 * boundary in the Content-Type field. If it finds one, it breaks
 * the message up along that boundary; if it doesn't, it assumes
 * that this is a single-part message, and your first call to
 * nextPart and getPartData will just return the entire content 
 * of the InputStream following the header.
 * <p>
 * To make it easy to test this class out, I included a main method
 * so you can run this as a stand-alone class at the command line. 
 * The meat of the main method is as follows:
 * <p>
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 * SimpleMimeReader smr = new SimpleMimeReader(new FileInputStream(args[0]));
 * 
 * System.out.println("BOUNDARY: " + smr.getBoundaryText());
 * System.out.println("PREAMBLE: " + smr.getPreamble());
 * System.out.println("CONTENT-TYPE: " + getHeaderValue(smr.getMessageHeader(), "content-type"));
 * System.out.println("MESSAGE HEADER:\n" + smr.getMessageHeader());
 *
 * ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
 * int count = 0;
 * while (smr.nextPart()) {
 *     count++;
 *     System.out.println("----------\nPART " + count + "\n----------");
 *     System.out.println("TYPE: " + smr.getPartType());
 *     System.out.println("ENCODING: " + smr.getPartEncoding());
 *     System.out.println("CONTENT ID: " + smr.getPartID());
 *     System.out.println("HEADER:\n" + smr.getPartHeader());
 *     long size = smr.getPartData(baos);
 *     System.out.println("BODY LENGTH: " + size);
 *     
 *     baos.writeTo(new FileOutputStream(args[0] + ".file" + count));
 *     baos.reset();
 * }
 * 
 * System.out.println("----------");
 * System.out.println("EPILOGUE: " + smr.getEpilogue());
 * </pre></blockquote><hr><p>
 * None of the methods in this class throw exceptions. Instead, any
 * anticipated exceptions that occur are dealt with silently and 
 * discarded. That's because this is supposed to be a "simple" reader,
 * and I didn't think you should have to get bogged down with too
 * much exception handling. If that really bothers you, it should be
 * trivial to add exceptions to the code yourself.
 * <p>
 * This code was originally written by me (Julian Robichaux). 
 * I've tested this class with the 1.1.8 and the 1.3.1 JDK. Updates to
 * this program will be posted to my website, at 
 * <a href='http://www.nsftools.com'>http://www.nsftools.com</a>
